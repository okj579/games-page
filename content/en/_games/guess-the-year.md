Imagine Wordle, but for Math Geeks ðŸ¤“ (but don't worry if you're not)

And now try to guess all the years of the 13th century with the provided clues.

You start with a "blind" guess and then will be given clues based on the fun mathematical properties your guess shares with the secret number.

These properties are:

- even/odd
- prime factors
- sum of digits
- (more to come in future versions ðŸ˜‰)

Each round will be a new random number in that range. And you can collect stars based on your performance.

Don't know where to start or how to continue? Check out the cheat sheet.

Had enough of the 13th century? Check out the other ranges via the config wheel.

Have fun!
