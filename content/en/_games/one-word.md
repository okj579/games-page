One Word is a cooperative, word-guessing party game. Players take turn trying to guess a word with single-word hints given by their teammates. There's a catch though: if any players sumbit the same hint, both get removed and the guesser has to try to work out what the word is with whatever hints are left.

This game was implemented at the beginning of the COVID pandemic as family members on lockdown were unable to get together for game night.

The game works best with a group on a video chat.
