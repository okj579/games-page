In this cooperative multiplayer game, players choose "paintings", in the form of emojis, matching a specific theme to submit to art buyers.
But, some forgeries have also been smuggled in.

The buyers must then decide which of the paintings were submitted by their teammates to match the theme and which are randomized forgeries.

The game works best with a group on a video chat.
