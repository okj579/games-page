Listen to emojis and echo them with the buttons before the slots run out! Or practice without pressure.

Play the predefined games or customize your own.

Notes:
- sound encouraged and even required for a big part
- if you have issues displaying most emojis, try the nostalgia set
- on some systems the flags won't be properly displayed (especially Windows)
- in general, if you have any emoji issues, you can always configure your own game

If I had more time, I would:
- make the score/star system more mature
- improve the language/voice selection
